		<div><h4>Respected Sir ,</h4></div>
		<div><p> &emsp;&emsp;I am writing permission for leave letter to request for a leave. My last leave was one year ago, and I feel it is only fair that I request for one at this time. Leave at this moment is convenient for me since I would like to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with my family back home.

			I am humbly requesting 30 days’ leave to have enough time to enjoy the company of my family. During the leave, I will be traveling a lot to reconnect with my extended family who is scattered in various cities in the country; therefore, 30 days will give me ample time to accomplish all this.
			
			Throughout the year, I have been a dedicated employee, and this leave will accord me time to resuscitate and get ready for the next working year. I would highly appreciate it if you allow me to go on leave on 5th December 2020. I will be back in the office on 5th January 2021.</p></div>
